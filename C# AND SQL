üß† C# Senior-Level Interview Questions with Code & Explanation

1. What is Dependency Injection in C#?
Explanation: It‚Äôs a design pattern that allows you to inject dependencies into a class rather than hardcoding them.

`csharp
public interface IMessageService {
    void SendMessage(string message);
}

public class EmailService : IMessageService {
    public void SendMessage(string message) {
        Console.WriteLine("Email sent: " + message);
    }
}

public class Notification {
    private readonly IMessageService _messageService;

    public Notification(IMessageService messageService) {
        _messageService = messageService;
    }

    public void Notify(string message) {
        _messageService.SendMessage(message);
    }
}
`
Why it matters: Promotes loose coupling and testability.

---

2. What is the difference between IEnumerable and IQueryable?
`csharp
IEnumerable<Product> products = db.Products.ToList(); // Executes query immediately
IQueryable<Product> productsQuery = db.Products; // Deferred execution
`
Explanation:  
- IEnumerable is for in-memory operations.  
- IQueryable is for remote data sources like databases and supports query translation.

---

3. How do you implement a thread-safe Singleton?
`csharp
public sealed class Singleton {
    private static readonly Lazy<Singleton> instance = new Lazy<Singleton>(() => new Singleton());

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton Instance => instance.Value;
}
`
Explanation:  
- Lazy<T> ensures thread safety and lazy initialization.  
- sealed prevents inheritance.

---

4. What is async and await in C#?
`csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync() {
    await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate async work
    return "Data received";
}
`
Explanation:  
- async marks a method for asynchronous execution.  
- await pauses execution until the task completes.

---

5. What is Reflection in C#?
`csharp
Type type = typeof(Person);
PropertyInfo[] properties = type.GetProperties();
foreach (var prop in properties) {
    Console.WriteLine(prop.Name);
}
`
Explanation:  
- Reflection allows inspection and manipulation of metadata at runtime.  
- Useful for dynamic type handling.

üóÉÔ∏è SQL Senior-Level Interview Questions (with Code & Explanation)

---

üîπ 1. What is a Common Table Expression (CTE)?

`sql
WITH SalesCTE AS (
  SELECT SalesPersonID, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
  FROM Sales
  GROUP BY SalesPersonID
)
SELECT * FROM SalesCTE WHERE TotalSales > 10000;
`

Explanation:  
CTEs improve readability and can be reused in the same query. They also support recursion.

---

üîπ 2. How to get the nth highest salary?

`sql
SELECT salary FROM (
  SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
  FROM Employees
) AS Ranked
WHERE rank = 3;
`

Explanation:  
Use DENSE_RANK() to assign ranks and filter by the desired rank.

---

üîπ 3. Difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN

`sql
-- INNER JOIN
SELECT e.Name, d.Name
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DeptID = d.ID;

-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT e.Name, d.Name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.DeptID = d.ID;
`

Explanation:  
- INNER JOIN: Only matching rows.  
- LEFT JOIN: All rows from left table, NULLs if no match.

---

üîπ 4. What is a Window Function?

`sql
SELECT Name, Salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS SalaryRank
FROM Employees;
`

Explanation:  
Window functions perform calculations across rows related to the current row without collapsing results.

---

üîπ 5. How to calculate running totals?

`sql
SELECT OrderID, OrderDate,
       SUM(Amount) OVER (ORDER BY OrderDate) AS RunningTotal
FROM Orders;
`

`sql
SELECT ProductID,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Month = 'Jan' THEN Sales ELSE 0 END) AS JanSales,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Month = 'Feb' THEN Sales ELSE 0 END) AS FebSales
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY ProductID;
`

Explanation:  
Use CASE with GROUP BY to pivot rows into columns.

---

üîπ 8. What is a clustered vs non-clustered index?

Explanation:
- Clustered Index: Sorts and stores data rows in the table based on key.
- Non-Clustered Index: Separate structure with pointers to data rows.

`sql
-- Clustered
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idxempid ON Employees(ID);

-- Non-Clustered
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idxempname ON Employees(Name);
`

---

üîπ 9. How to find duplicate records?

`sql
SELECT Name, COUNT(*) 
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
`

Explanation:  
Use GROUP BY and HAVING to filter duplicates.

---

üîπ 10. How to delete duplicates but keep one?

`sql
WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY ID) AS rn
  FROM Employees
)
DELETE FROM CTE WHERE rn > 1;
`

Explanation:  
Use ROW_NUMBER() to identify duplicates and delete those with rank > 1.
